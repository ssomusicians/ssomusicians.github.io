In a unionized workplace like ours, anything that falls under wages, hours, and
working conditions is subject to bargaining, and can be up for debate when it
comes time to negotiate a new contract. We work together with our management
and board to come to agreements on all kinds of issues beyond wages. There are
a vast range of topics addressed in our contract that are specific to the
nature of our work as performers. We’d like to take a moment to share a few of
those with you today. All of these topics are routine components of symphony
contracts around the country.

### Temperature

We have defined an acceptable temperature range for indoor and outdoor work.
This is essential for musician and instrument health. Just like athletes, our
muscles are less likely to be injured in a warm environment. The same goes for
delicate wood instruments like piccolos, clarinets, oboes, and bassoons. These
instruments can be destroyed or require expensive repairs if they are exposed
to extreme temperatures and the wood cracks as it contracts and expands.

### Smoke

All of us living in the Spokane area are no stranger to air quality concerns as
we’ve had smokier summers plagued by wildfires. This is unfortunately a major
concern for our outdoor parks concerts during the summer and fall. While clean
air is important for everyone’s health, for wind players, our livelihood
depends on our ability to take very deep breaths to play! We were able to
negotiate AQI limits in 2018 based on the guidelines followed by the City of
Spokane Parks & Recreation and Spokane Public Schools at that time.

### Breaks, service length, and weekly caps

Our jobs are physically demanding and can lead to muscle fatigue and repetitive
stress injuries like tendonitis and carpal tunnel. We have limits on the amount
of time we can be required to play without a break so that we can stretch, use
the bathroom, and rest. Because of our low wages, most of us balance symphony
work with other performance gigs and teaching, placing further demands on our
bodies. Therefore, we have a limit on the number of services we can be required
to play in a given week.

### Music availability

As we discussed [in a previous post]({% post_url 2023-09-16-part-time %}),
most of our preparation happens long before the first rehearsal for a
concert. We have to get our music well in advance to be able to do that work.
We have a provision in our contract that requires music to be available at
least two weeks before a Masterworks week so that we have plenty of time to
learn the music and be prepared to perform fantastic concerts for you.

We hope this post gives you a taste of the complexity of our workplace and the
many details that have to be considered for great music-making to take place
week after week.
