**How many years have you been a member of the Spokane Symphony, and do you have additional work outside of the Symphony?**
I have been a member of the Spokane Symphony for 46 years.  For most of my career with the Spokane Symphony I taught instrumental music in the public schools, was an adjunct professor at Whitworth, a freelance musician, and a private percussion instructor. Now, it’s all of the above minus the public school teaching.  Over the years I’ve done some of the Broadway touring shows (Sugar Babies, Man of La Mancha), supplemented the GU Orchestra and Choral concerts, played with Super Sparkle and Moko Jumbie, provided solo vibes background music for receptions and events, filled in for church worship groups and recorded and released out my own music on iTunes and Spotify.

**How many hours a week would you say you spend doing non-SSO work?**
During a regular school year, I work, now, about 12 hours per week on non-SSO work. When I taught public school, it was about 45 hours per week.


**How do you balance your various jobs?**
At first it was very difficult, but then I got organized and kept a calendar so my wife and family knew when I would be around. When there are scheduling conflicts, I either have to cancel something or rearrange my schedule while maintaining the relationships with the people I am working with.


**How old were you when you began learning music?**
I was 8 years old when I started piano lessons and 9 years old when I started playing drums in the school band and taking drum lessons. Recently I realized that having started in the Tacoma Junior Symphony as a 10-year-old, COVID was my first year “off” from playing in an orchestra in 54 years.
