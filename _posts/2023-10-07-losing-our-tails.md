_A quick update: We’ve come to an agreement on our contract for this season,
2023-24. While we continue to be frustrated with recurring one-year agreements,
lost wages to inflation and covid, and a lack of commitment to our future in
this organization, we are pleased to agree on changes to our dress (read on
below!). We will be back at the bargaining table in less than a year and our
quest for better wages and working conditions continues. We’ll go into more
detail about this in future posts. Please stay in touch to hear more from us
throughout the year. [Sign up for our newsletter](https://eepurl.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=91f61ecba613b6bb7517ff24e&id=1823ed3b2d&e=28b08a3c59)

If you come to our Masterworks 2 concerts this weekend, you might notice there
are no tails! In this new contract, we and our management have agreed to update
our dress to be more modern. 

Over the last 20 years, orchestras all over the world have been moving away
from tailcoats and tuxedos to all black dress. 

We think this is great because tails are:
* Uncomfortable and hot on stage
* Dry-clean only
* Expensive

Tailcoats are also impractical for certain instruments. 

Neckties get in the way of violins and violas. 

Floppy coats interfere with woodwind keys and horn bells. 

It is difficult for bassists and cellists to move their arms freely to play.

All black for everyone equalizes our ensemble by having the same dress standard for all.
