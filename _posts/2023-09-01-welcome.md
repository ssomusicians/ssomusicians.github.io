## Did you know?

* Musicians are hard workers
* Musicians are paid professionals
* We have moved to Spokane from all over the world for this job - [see our map of hometowns here!](http://www.spokanesymphonymusicians.org/about-us/)
* We have been practicing since we were children
* We have a similar level of professional training to doctors and lawyers
* We are responsible for providing and maintaining our instruments, which can cost thousands of dollars each year
* We prepare for rehearsals and concerts outside of paid working hours
* In addition to performing, we serve students at our local colleges, in the public schools, and as private teachers
* We have our own union to maintain integrity and high standards in our workplace

## HEAR US

To maintain the professional-level orchestra that we have built, we need:

* Wages that reflect the increasing cost of living in Spokane
* Pay that reflects our increased workload over the last few decades
* More Symphony presence in our schools, community, and region

We are currently negotiating a new contract.

If you want to help us achieve our goals and secure a great future for our orchestra, please share this information with your friends and family.
