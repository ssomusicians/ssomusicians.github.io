**How many years have you been a member of the Spokane Symphony?**
I have been with the SSO for 14 years.


**How old were you when you began learning bass?**
I was 10 when I started playing the bass, but I had started trumpet the year before in school.  I was offered free lessons with the local youth orchestra to start the bass and play in the beginnersâ€™ group. 


**How old were you when you decided to pursue a career in music?**
I was 17, senior year of high school.  Maybe later than most, but I was sitting in rehearsal with the Chicago Youth Symphony and thought I should do this for a living because I loved it so much. 


**What help did you receive when you were young to get you to this level of playing?**
My family support was huge. From driving me to lessons and rehearsals, to buying a car big enough for everyone and a bass. And when I went away to college, my parents were very supportive of my career choices. Without all this, I might not have been able to do the exciting things I have been able to do with my music career


**How many years past high school did you continue school for the training you needed to reach this level of performing?**
I did 10 years of college, finishing most of my work for a Doctorate in Music at Indiana University before I realized that I really loved playing in an orchestra and so I focused on winning an audition!
