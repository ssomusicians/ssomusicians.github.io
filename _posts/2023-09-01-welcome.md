## Did you know?

·      Musicians are hard workers

·      Musicians are paid professionals

·      We have moved to Spokane from all over the world for this job

    ·      see our map of hometowns here! [!musicianmap](http://www.spokanesymphonymusicians.org/about-us/)

·      We started our musical training as toddlers, and continue to practice regularly

·      We have a similar level of professional training to doctors and lawyers

·      We are responsible for providing and maintaining our instruments, which can cost thousands of dollars each year

·      We prepare for rehearsals and concerts outside of paid working hours

·      In addition to performing, we serve students at our local colleges, in the public schools, and as private teachers

·      We have our own union to maintain integrity and high standards in our workplace

 

## HEAR US: 

To maintain the professional-level orchestra that we have built, we need

·      Wages that reflect the changing cost of living in Spokane – [!GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NGMP44060)

·      Pay that reflects our increased workload over the last few decades

·      More Symphony presence in our schools, community, and region

 

We are currently negotiating a new contract.

If you want to help us achieve our goals (or want to keep having a great symphony orchestra), please share this information with your friends and family.
