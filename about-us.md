This site offers you a behind the scenes look at what we're all about. If you'd
like to know more about who we are, what exactly it is we do, or how and why we
do it, you 've come to the right place. This orchestra is an unusually diverse
group. While many of us have long-standing family connections to the area, an
increasing number of musicians have relocated to Spokane from all around the
nation, expressly to be part of this terrific ensemble. As a whole, we comprise
your symphony orchestra, and we serve our region in a variety of ways. You can
find us performing together, on the stage of the Fox and in other venues around
town, as well as individually, producing our own occasional recitals or faculty
concerts. We also bring our skills and passion to bear by providing music
instruction in numerous capacities throughout the area. Above all, we endeavor
to inspire and enrich our community, delivering the powerful beauty of great
music to the Inland Northwest.
